    <h1>Digital Art</h1>
    <p>Digital art is one of the newest forms of art for me and I first started exploring it in 2020 during the COVID Era. I ahad struggled a lot with the medium at first as I could not see how it was suppose to be like how art is traditionally done. The more I worked on it, the more I liked it and found what made it so intreiging to other artists. </p>
