        “Olivia Walton is a young artist who loves to experiment in any medium. Right now she is working through college, figuring out her major, and trying to grow her skills in art through the classes they provide. She has tried everything ranging from watercolors and oil paints to sewing, metalwork and jewelry, spray painting, and digital artwork and wants to investigate even more mediums. Art has helped her understand the world and by using all these different mediums she tells stories to help her connect to those around her, and the world the way she sees it. “

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        Due to her wide range of abilities, her art can be found on Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, and more. This page of the website is used as a home for her most recent and her favorite works. These pieces will be in many different mediums; ranging from paints, to sculpture, digital, and more. It will also provide some information and details about the artworks that might not be listed elsewhere.

      <h3>Through The Ages</h3>
      <p>
        Acrylic has been my first official art medium that I worked with, starting with watered-down pictures of fish and flowers, to detailed paintings of birds and mountains. Because of the length of time spent to grow this skill, I included a page to show the growth of pieces through the years and the work that has gone into it.   (the page will ahev three picture layering next to eachother with text under/besides with a bit of detail of when it was, and what it was.)
