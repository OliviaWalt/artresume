      <p class="w1">Acrylic has been my first official art medium that I worked with, starting with watered-down pictures of fish and flowers, to detailed paintings of birds and mountains. Because of the length of time spent to grow this skill, I included a page to show the growth of pieces through the years and the work that has gone into it. </p>

      <p id="w2">I love working with acrylics because I find it is a very forgiving medium for mistakes. Whenever I put paint in the wrong spot or added the wrong color, all I had to do was wait a few minutes for it to dry, then paint over what I had mistaken. Along with this forgiveness came an ability to do a lot of detail. As seen in the feather. Picture and the waterfall I loved getting small brushes and creating small exact lines to add detail, it added movement to the piece which I found hard to add otherwise. </p>
