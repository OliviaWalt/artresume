            <p class="acrylicp">I have grown up using acrylics in almost all my art pieces since I was little because I love the feel and ability acrylic has to add details and be forgiving. I continued to grow my skill through High School in my art classes, and eventually my Advance Placement classes. I continue to work on my skills and have been able to sell some of my art pieces, as well as growing my skills in college level classes as I study. </p>

                <p class="digitalp">Digital art has been a recent adenture for me. I started it right as COVID-19 started, allowing me to dig into exsporing the new medium with more focus then I had been able to with any other. Since then I have continued my deep dive by watching other artists suggestions, adding digital brushes, and practcing my skills in images like this one. This has allowed me to practice skills I dont feel conifdent doing in other mediums, such as people.</p>

            <p class="oilp">I had never touched Oil Paints before this piece. It was part of a class I was able to take in college where we learned how to use and create with the medium. This was the final project, and it is one of my proudest pieces due to the time, skills, effort, and focus required to achomplish the look of the reflection and perspective. I continue to wish to gerow my skills in further classes and exsperimentation. </p>
