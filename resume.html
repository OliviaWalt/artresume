            <p>I have grown up using acrylics in almost all my art pieces since I was little. I continued to grow my skill through High School in my art classes, and everntually my Advance Placement classes as well. I continue to work on my skills and have been able to sell some pieces as well. </p>

            <p>Digital art has been a recent adenture for me. I started it right as COVID-19 had started, alloowing me to dig into exsporing the new medium. Since then I have continued my deep dive by watching other artists suggestions, adding digital burhses, and practcing my skills in images like this one.</p>

            <p>I had never touched Oil Paints before this piece. It was part of a class I was able to take in college where we learned the medium. THis was the final project, and it is one of my proudest pieces due to the time, skills, effort, and focus required to achomplish the look of the reflection and perspective. </p>
